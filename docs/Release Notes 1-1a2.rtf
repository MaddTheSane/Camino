\f0\b\fs30 \cf2 About Camino 1.1 Alpha 2\
\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\ql\qnatural

\f1\b0\fs20 \cf2 Camino 1.1 Alpha 2 is a heavily-updated version of the only native Mac OS X browser using Mozilla.org\'d5s Gecko HTML rendering engine. Notable improvements include enhanced tabbed browsing (\'d2single window mode\'d3), integration with the Mac OS X spell-checking system, detection of RSS/Atom feeds, an improved design for the \'d2blocked pop-up\'d3 notification, enhanced options for cookies and downloads, and a resizable search field in the toolbar. This release also includes enhancements in speed, security, and rendering accuracy brought by version 1.8.1 of the Gecko rendering engine.\
\
Note that Camino 1.1 Alpha 2 is in the \'d2alpha\'d3 stage, which means it is still under active development. We feel that it is usable on a day-to-day basis and is a large improvement over Camino 1.0, but you may still experience bugs and some functionality may not work entirely as intended. The goal of this early release is to demonstrate the team\'d5s progress and to allow users to report problems early in the development cycle.\
\
Camino 1.1 Alpha 2 shares the same code base as Firefox 2.0, both being based on version 1.8.1 of Gecko, and thus shares many of the security fixes and Gecko improvements that are in that version of Firefox.\
\
Due to changes in the feature set, Camino 1.1 Alpha 2 no longer supports Mac OS X 10.2. We advise users still running Mac OS X 10.2 to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.caminobrowser.org/download/releases/1.0.3/"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 download Camino 1.0.3}}\cf0  ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.caminobrowser.org/releases/1.0.3.php"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 release notes}}).\cf2 \

\f1\b0\fs20 \cf2 	\'a5	Some users report have reported that their bookmarks have disappeared when relaunching Camino and the Camino\'d5s bookmarks backup file is corrupted. Users are advised to make regular copies of their bookmarks. \
	\'a5	Some users have experienced a situation where pages would appear not to load after clicking on a link. In this case, resizing the browser window will cause the page to display properly. \
	\'a5	The version of RealPlayer released in May 2006, version 10.1.0 (v400), causes Camino to crash when viewing any Real content. Real has released RealPlayer 10.1.0 (v412) to address this issue.  Users should re-download RealPlayer and verify (using the application\'d5s About window) that it is version 412 before launching Camino.\
	\'a5	Microsoft\'d5s Windows Media Player (WMP) plugin causes major rendering issues in Camino. Since Microsoft has discontinued WMP on Mac OS X, Camino no longer supports the use of the WMP plugin; instead, all users should download the free Flip4Mac (F4M) plugin, version 2.1 or higher, from {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.flip4mac.com/"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 http://www.flip4mac.com/}}.  Version 2.1 causes pages containing WMP content to become white when scrolled in Camino; there is currently no ETA for a fixed version of the F4M plugin.\
	\'a5	Due to a bug in Mac OS X 10.3.x, Norwegian users of Camino will need to manually set their \'d4accept-language\'d5 string. To set the accept-language string, add the string 
\f3 user_pref("camino.accept_languages", "nb,nn,no,en");
\f1  to your {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.caminobrowser.org/support/hiddenprefs/#createUserjs"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 user.js file}}, where the languages are listed in the order in which you\'d5d prefer them if a server can send content in multiple languages. (In this example, you want Bokm\'8cl first, then Nynorsk, then generic Norwegian, then English if none of the other three languages are available.) You may now launch Camino.\
		Apple fixed this bug in Mac OS X 10.4, so no workarounds are necessary.\
	\'a5	Camino erroneously claims that the default Japanese and Traditional Chinese fonts are \'d2missing\'d3 when they are actually installed; this is due to a mismatch between Carbon and Cocoa font names.  Changing these fonts using the Camino user interface will result in incorrect fonts being chosen and will cause some characters to fail to display.  Users should either keep the default fonts or change the font preferences manually, ensuring the Carbon versions of the font names are used.\
	\'a5	Some users have experienced an issue where downloading files will cause Camino to hang when Quicksilver is installed. Users can work around this issue by either disabling indexing of the Desktop in Quicksilver or by setting the default download location to somewhere other than the Desktop in Camino\'d5s Downloads preferences.}
