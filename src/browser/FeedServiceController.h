This is a simple controller class that handles notifications to the user when
dealing with opening feeds from within Camino. 

If the user attempts to open a feed detected in Camino, this class checks for
available applications that are registered for "feed://". If there are no
applications found, display a sheet that warns the user and allows them to 
select a application. If there are feed applications found, run a sheet that 
allows the user to choose a new default feed viewer, and open or cancel the 
opening action.
