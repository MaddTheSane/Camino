Sparkle is an MIT-like-licensed framework used for Camino's auto-update
functionality. See http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/ for more information about
Sparkle. The Sparkle framework is shipped inside Camino's bundle, and some glue
code is included in Camino itself.

This is a pull of fe1372c9621a38978f03bc5773342e8716dcc1e3 from git://github.com/andymatuschak/Sparkle.git
with the following changes:
- Skipped the delta-updates changes (803676d56a5f9de18e1b and 19ae8506ab1d54287c87), since that code doesn't yet build on 10.4
- Commented out used of [arch=<foo>] notation in ConfigCommon.xcconfig to allow building with our toolchain
- Commented out ARCHS in ConfigCommon.xcconfig and replaced it with a version that doesn't include x86_64
- Changed GCC_GENERATE_DEBUGGING_SYMBOLS to YES (and set GCC_ENABLE_SYMBOL_SEPARATION to NO) in ConfigCommonRelease.xcconfig so that we get a dSYM bundle.
- Removed a __dead2 annotation in relaunch.m (along with -Wmissing-noreturn in ConfigCommon.xcconfig) to fix 10.4 compilation.
