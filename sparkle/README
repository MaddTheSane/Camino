Sparkle is an MIT-like-licensed framework used for Camino's auto-update
functionality. See http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/ for more information about
Sparkle. The Sparkle framework is shipped inside Camino's bundle, and some glue
code is included in Camino itself.

This is a pull of revision 343 of the lp:sparkle branch from http://code.launchpad.net/sparkle
with the following changes:
- Commented out used of [arch=<foo>] notation in ConfigCommon.xcconfig to allow building with our toolchain
- Commented out ARCHS in ConfigCommonRelease.xcconfig and replaced it with a version that doesn't include x86_64
- Added a conditional definition of NSAppKitVersionNumber10_4 to SUPackageInstaller.m for 10.4 SDK build support (in the process of being upstreamed)
