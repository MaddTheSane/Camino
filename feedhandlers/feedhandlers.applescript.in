	We're going to split the inURL string on colons (:) and append non-"feed"
	fragments to build the full URL we send to the handler.  We do this because
	we can get feed urls in	the following five formats
	feed:http://
	feed:https://
	feed://
	feed:feed://
	feed:feed:http://
	and because some feeds have unescaped colons (:) in the URL string, e.g. 
	http://wiki.caminobrowser.org/index.php?title=Special:Recentchanges&feed=atom

	If the first text item is feed, get rid of it.  If the second item is also
	feed, get rid of it.  Then, if the third text item is http or https, take
	it and the whole rest of the string (it's a valid url).  Otherwise, append 
	http in front of the third item.

	If the second text item is http or https, take it and the whole rest of the
	string (it's a valid url).  Else ( //server.tld/url ) append http to the 
	rest of the string.  This works fine as long as we're never handed URIs in
	the format feed://http://server.tld/url or feed://https://server.tld/url.
	Restore the TIDs when we're done constructing the URL we'll send back to 
	Camino.
