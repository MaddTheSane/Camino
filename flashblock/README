Flash blocking for Camino is implemented using the Flashblock extension
from http://flashblock.mozdev.org/.  Flashblock is available under the
MPL/GPL/LGPL tri-license.  The files necessary for operation in Camino
are placed in the content directory and referenced by the jar.mn
manifest.

Camino's bundled Flashblock extension is currently synchronized with
Flashblock 1.5.13+ from
http://downloads.mozdev.org/flashblock/flashblock-1.5.unstable.xpi
plus the fix for bug 573815.
