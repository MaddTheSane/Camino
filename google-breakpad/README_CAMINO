Breakpad is an open-source library for crash reporting. See:
  http://code.google.com/p/google-breakpad/
for more information.

This is a pull of r841 from the svn repository at:
  http://google-breakpad.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
with many testing and non-mac platform directories stripped out, and the following
source changes:
- privacyPolicyURL in Localizable.strings has been changed to point to Camino's website.
- Kept the pre-XIB-conversion NIBs, and all XIB references in projects to NIB. (The relevant XIBs had not changed since conversion.)
As well as the following Xcode project and xcconfig canges:
- Commented out the SDK declarations to support mozconfig-based configurations.
- Commented out any Xcode 3.1-style [<foo>=<bar>] notation and supplied non-configuration-specific values where appropriate.
