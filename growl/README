Growl is a BSD-licensed framework that allows applications to provide 
notifications to users.  See http://www.growl.info/ for more information about
Growl. The Growl framework is shipped inside Camino's bundle, and some glue
code is included in Camino itself.

This is Growl 1.2+ (4461:fac59330ff0c) from http://growl.info/hg/growl-development/archive/fac59330ff0c.zip
with the following changes:
- Only the source files needed to build the "Growl.framework" target have been included.
- Made the following changes to Growl.xcodeproj:
  - Converted to Xcode 3.0 format to make it more compatible with Xcode 2.5 toolchain on 10.4.
  - Commented out the SDK declarations to support mozconfig-based configurations.
  - Commented out any Xcode 3.1-style [arch=<foo>] notation and supplied non-arch-specific values where appropriate.
  - Supplied valid archs for building with toolchains on Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5.
  - Set the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to 10.4 in all configurations.
  - Changed the default build configuration to Release.
  - Disabled the incompatible save-repository setting to prevent bustage when building on 10.4.
