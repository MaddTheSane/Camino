Growl is a BSD-licensed framework that allows applications to provide 
notifications to users.  See http://www.growl.info/ for more information about
Growl. The Growl framework is shipped inside Camino's bundle, and some glue
code is included in Camino itself.

This is Growl 1.1.4 (4886) from http://www.growl.info/files/source/Growl-1.1.4-src.tar.bz2
with the following changes:
- Only the source files needed to build the "Growl.framework" target have been included.
- Commented out the SDK declarations in Growl.xcodeproj to support mozconfig-based configurations.
- Debug symbol format for Deployment was changed to DWARF+dSYM for better breakpad symbol generation, and the incompatible save-repository disabled.
